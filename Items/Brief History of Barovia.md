Book given to [[Vayl Veliknova]] by [[Count Strahd von Tzarovich]]

- Prince Ariel du Plumette - Prince Ariel was a terrible man who longed to fly. He attached artificial wings to a harness and empowered the device with magic, but the apparatus still couldn’t bear his weight, and he plunged from the Pillarstone of Ravenloft to his death. 
- King Troisky - He had a helm with three evenly spaced visors crafted to look like human faces—one sad, one happy, and one angry. His demeanor often reflected the primary face on the helm. 
- King Katsky - He always carried a stoppered horn and a long weird looking scepter made of metal and wood, believed he was from the future and loved inventing contraptions. 
- Sir Sedrik Spinwitovich - Famous Admiral who commanded the largest navy in Barovia. In actuality, it was only a single ship that sailed around Lake Zarovich. 
- [[Orlin Wiildheart]] - Last great leader of the mountain folk and champion of the Huntress. Died defending the great Gulthias Tree against Strahd. 
- General Kroval “Mad Dog” Grislek - A great wartime general who lead not only men but packs of war dogs as well. His connection to the beasts was so strong it was said that he must be part dog as well. 
- King Dostron - An ancient ruler of this land, long before the arrival of Strahd. He claimed descent from a duke of the Nine Hells, and his deeds did justice to this ancestry.
