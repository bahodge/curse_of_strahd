After killing all of the leaders and fighters in the druid summoning ritual, the group of [[Wildfolk]] we spoke to came up and spoke with us. [[Gell Wiildheart]] holds up the [[Bloodaxe of Orland]] and all of the [[Wildfolk]] all bow down to [[Gell Wiildheart]] as the [[Bloodaxe of Orland]] names him as the heir. The [[Wildfolk]] all agree to help us in our endeavors. [[Gell Wiildheart]] becomes the champion of the [[Wildfolk]]. A representative of the [[Wildfolk]] is selected. We learn that the [[Shrine of the Huntress]]. We also learn that the [[Spirit of the Huntress]] is in hibernation in the [[Ghak's Mountains]].

We collected the missing gem for the [[Wizards of Wine]] and make our way down the mountain. We hand the stone back to the [[Vensha Family]] and they are very grateful. We explain to the [[Vensha Family]] that the [[Wildfolk]] were previously corrupted by blood druids.

We learn that we have ingratiated ourselves with the ravens. We are given the [[Holy Symbol of Raven-Kind]] and [[Sumrak]] takes it.

(added to quests)
We need to take wine deliveries to [[Village of Kresk]], [[Town of Velakki]] and the [[Western Vistani Camp]]. We have 6 casks total.
- 3 [[Town of Velakki]]
- 2 [[Village of Kresk]]
- 1 [[Vistani]]

We decide to head to the [[Village of Kresk]] with [[Adrien Vensha]] and [[Muriel Vensha]]. We inform the [[Granny Morgan]] that we have gotten stronger by helping free the [[Wildfolk]]. After visiting Kresk we will stop at the [[Western Mage Tower]] to visit [[Rudolph Van Richten]]. We arrive at [[Village of Kresk]] and we are hurried in by the guard. [[Adrien Vensha]] is immediately recognized and we are let in. We explore the village a little bit.

We should speak to the [[Burgomaster Dimitri Kreskov]]. We learn that the [[Abbot of Kresk]] has not left his church since the [[Dinner at Castle Ravenloft]], weeks ago.
We are paid 50gp for delivering the wine to [[Village of Kresk]]. We learn that the son of [[Burgomaster Dimitri Kreskov]] has just died of a mysterious illness, he was 14 years old. [[Fyndal Kayne]] says that the symptoms are very similar to the symptoms people suffered from in the [[Village of Barovia]].

We speak to a blacksmith and get a quote on plate armor
- 1500GP without any ore
- 750GP with ore
- negotiable if we take care of the werewolves and help [[Burgomaster Dimitri Kreskov]]

The blacksmith notices the silver coffer [[Fyndal Kayne]] and offers to buy it but we don't sell it. Instead we silver [[Vayl Veliknova|Vayl]]'s halberd.

We head to the [[Abby of Kresk]] and [[Fyndal Kayne]] hugs a statue and [[Vayl Veliknova]] skips a rock further than [[Fyndal Kayne]], again proving how awesome she is. Nothing happens. We approach the abby and see 2 heaving piles of fur. Out pop 2 [[Mongrelfolk]] guarding the Abby, [[Zigfrik Bellvue]] and [[Otto Bellevue]]. We move into the courtyard of the Abby. We learn that the [[Mongrelfolk]] come from the abby, which tells us that that the [[Abbot of Kresk]] has something to do with [[Cyrus Bellevue]]. We learn that the [[Mongrelfolk]] at the Abby are jealous of [[Cyrus Bellevue]] because of his freedoms and working for [[Count Strahd von Tzarovich|Strahd]].
