## City of Vellaki

We have 2 days left until we need to get to the [[Castle Ravenloft]]. It is rather late in the day. We meet up at the inn and begin our journey to the [[Western Mage Tower]] to meet [[Rudolph Van Richten]]. On our way out of town, we see [[Milevoj]] who reminds us to look for the hunters who should be helping find the boys. On our way out of town, we speak with the guards who give us directions to the [[Western Mage Tower]]. The guards remind us to stay on the road. There are reports of hill people and wolves all to the west of the [[Town of Velakki]].

## Western Vellaki

We come across a camp and meet 2 hunters, [[Szoldnar]] and [[Yevgenni]].  These are the hunters that [[Milevoj]] hired to find the boys. [[Sumrak]] calls out one of the boy's name and he turns. We fight a horde of wolves and werewolves. We meed [[Zulika Toranzku]], a priestess of mother night. We will the hunters who were holding the children. We speak with [[Emil Toranzku]], [[Zulika Toranzku]]. They are enemies of [[Kiril Tsoylonovich]]. [[Hanz]] and [[Franz]] rip of their necklaces to hand to [[Milevoj]] as proof that they are doing well.

[[Sumrak]] is a werewolf.
