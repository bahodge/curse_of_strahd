The first person who disappeared is Karla, lived with parents who live in the home. She went missing 3 months ago. Second person missing was Korga, living alone and disappeared 2 months ago. Third person missing is Siraz Delsignia, lived with a foot servant, a [[Souless]], and went missing a few days ago. [[Granny Morgan]]'s pie is primarily sold to [[Souless]]. Lancelot (the dog)'s address is across the street from Siraz Delsignia's house. Gertruda disappeared 3 weeks ago. Mary Krezcov, Gertruda's mom, says she saw things in the square. She saw someone dragging a body. I suspect: [[Souless]] people may be "mind wiped" as they may be witnesses to people being abducted. We kill [[Doru Donovich]] and [[Father Donovich]]
