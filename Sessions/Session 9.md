Katy is out so, [[Saraphina Blackwood|Saraphina]] is out at the library to learn more about [[Village of Berez]] in relation to the reading done by [[Madam Ava]].

We make our way to go speak with [[Granny Morgan]] and confront her. We make our way to the [[Vistani]] camp near the [[Durst Mill]] to drop off horses. We arrive at the [[Vistani]] camp and drop our horses off with [[Loremaster Stanmere]]. We walk the rest of the way to the [[Durst Mill]]. We meet with [[Bella]] and she directs us towards the location of the [[Ravens]]. [[Granny Morgan]] is not around when we arrive.

We continue up the path toward the [[Ravens]]. We come upon 3 stone monoliths aligned in a large triangle. There is a circular mushroom ring the center of the monoliths. The [[Ravens]] are agitated by the ropes around the stones so we cut them. [[Dryad]]s appear and are angry about us cutting ropes. We fight the [[Dryad]]s. [[Vayl Veliknova|Vayl]] goes berzerk due to her axe and knocks down [[Sumrak]]. We then remove all the teeth from the monoliths. We discover that the shrine is related to [[Sethline of the Crooked Teeth]]. It is very likely that [[Granny Morgan]] is a worshiper of [[Sethline of the Crooked Teeth|Sethline]] and very likely a [[Hag]].

Plan for next session:
- Travel to the [[Vistani]] camp to prepare the ambush
- Forest ambush [[Granny Morgan]] at the bridge
