We awake in the inn to [[Yeska]] knocking on the door. [[Father Lucian Petrovich]] looked at [[Felix]] and he has confirmed the child is possessed. The grave keeper [[Milevoj]] had no sign of attack, so his illness must have something to do with the [[Shadow Demon]].

We eat breakfast at the inn. We walk down the street to the vendors. We all go on a spending spree and buy armor and equipment. The book vendor does not have a map of the[[Kingdom of Barovia]].  [[Vayl Veliknova]] and [[Saraphina Blackwood]] meet [[Leopard von Doyle]]. He says that the local fisherman, [[Bluto]] went missing near [[Lake Tzarovich]].  [[Leopard von Doyle]] says that [[Lady Fiona Wakter]] promised her daughter to the [[Burgomaster "Baron" Vargas Velokovich]]'s son. No one has seen. Strange blue flashes are emanate from from [[Barononette Victor Velokovich]]. 

We move to the [[Church of Saint Andarel]] and meet with [[Father Lucian Petrovich]]. He is not familiar with dealing with demons of this magnitude. [[Felix]] is not improving. We need to find out what materials and ceremonies are required to deal with the demon. We learn that [[Milevoj]] and [[Felix]] are getting worse by the day and are expected to die soon. 

We move to the [[Velakki Orphanage]] to speak with the [[Head Matron Claudia Belasco]] to get more information on the the child [[Felix]]. Scratching out the symbols on the beds of the children and everyone in the building slept well that night. [[Sumrak]] finds a book that describes [[Shadow Demon]]s. There are only 3 known shadow demons and it lists their names. The shadow demon name [[Zagral]] stands out.

Preparation for excorsims:
- know the demon's name or speak the language to persuade it to leave the host
- form of protection for the person leading the ritual
- once the demon is separated, it will try to possess someone else
- It must be contained in an object

[[Fyndal Kayne]] and [[Marcus Darkhelm]] meet [[Cook the Chef]] at the [[Mansion of Burgomaster Velokovich]].  The butler and lady in waiting have both gone missing. The [[Barononette Victor Velokovich|Baronette]] does not come down to eat and there are strange noises coming from his room. They meet the [[Lydia]] and calm her down with a song. They get invited to play at the next festival for their wondrous performance. They meet with [[Burgomaster "Baron" Vargas Velokovich]]. He is adamant about not having any involvement with the [[Lady Fiona Wakter]]. They leave the mansion with no new information gained.

We decide that we could try to trap the demon in a jewelry box that [[Fyndal Kayne]] has. [[Yeska]] brings us the holy water for the exorcism. We come up with a plan to exorcise the demon from [[Felix]]. We climb up to the attic to perform the exorcism. Turns out [[Felix]] actually did kill his parents according to [[Zagral]]. We move all the items out of the attic so the demon no longer has any items to attack us with. [[Sumrak]] tricks the demon by making him detach from [[Felix]]'s body, she then moves outside of the protection circle. We trap the demon in a jewelry box but don't have an immediate way to banish the demon, perhaps in [[Village of Kresk]]. [[Felix]]and [[Milevoj]] looks like they are doing better. We get 3 healing potions from [[Head Matron Claudia Belasco]] for saving the orphanage and told her to notify us as soon as [[Milevoj]] regains consciousness.

We meet [[Ernst Lanark]] and are delivered a invitation by [[Lady Fiona Wakter]] for dinner tonight. We accept the invitation. We get a coin purse from [[Ernst Lanark]] to purchase fancy clothes. We decide to distract the [[Burgomaster "Baron" Vargas Velokovich|Burgomaster]] and explore his [[Mansion of Burgomaster Velokovich|mansion]]. 

We speak with the [[Burgomaster "Baron" Vargas Velokovich]], and agreed that we would receive money and a reward to be presented at the festival. We drink [[Red Dragon Crush]]  and have fun telling stories. [[Fyndal Kayne|Fyndal]], [[Saraphina Blackwood|Saraphina]] and [[Marcus Darkhelm|Marcus]] explore the upper floors of the [[Mansion of Burgomaster Velokovich|mansion]] while the [[Burgomaster "Baron" Vargas Velokovich|burgomaster]] is distracted. They find a room with noises emanating from it. They continue up to the third floor. They come to a door with a skull and a sign saying "All is not well". They knock on the door of the [[Barononette Victor Velokovich|baronette]] and he sounds like a total neck beard. They peek into the room and see bones, three small children and various spell related items. They find the [[Barononette Victor Velokovich|baronette's]] [[Victor's Journal|journal]], it says some incriminating things. we decide to keep his journal possibly show it to [[Lady Fiona Wakter]].

Plan for next session:
- Investigate [[Bluto]]'s disappearance at [[Lake Tzarovich]]
- Go to dinner with [[Lady Fiona Wakter]]
- Decide on a reward from the [[Burgomaster "Baron" Vargas Velokovich]]
