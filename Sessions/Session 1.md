While at the college of spirits with [[Fyndal Kayne]] and [[Saraphina Blackwood]], mist rolls into the college  and knocks us out. We awake in the middle of a forest. The forest is surrounded by mist. We are guided through the mist to a giant gate. We then find a sign named [[Village of Barovia|Barovia]]. We continue down the road. We learn that [[Village of Barovia|Barovia]] is a village and also refers to the [[Kingdom of Barovia]] with the same name. We find a river a mile off the road. [[Marcus Darkhelm]] spears a large fish. We see some large [[Wolves]]. We discover a large house while following the main road. We come across 2 ghostly children. The kids say there is a monster in the basement. We investigate the house and look all over the house but can't find the basement. We fight a set of [[Possessed Armor]] and find some basic equipment.
