We begin walking to [[Lake Tzarovich]] to investigate the surrounding area. We arrive at the lake on the south shore and find 3 small rowboats.  [[Fyndal Kayne|Fyndal]] tries to skip a stone and it skips 6 times. We try and use a bunch of the fishing gear to try and catch some fish. The water on the lake is eerily still and shimmers in the twilight. We find a rowboat with a lot of wine bottles in it so we can assume that [[Bluto]] made it back to shore. We discover [[Bluto]]'s address as 4 Pore Street in [[Town of Velakki|Velakki]]. We head back to the [[Velakki Inn]] and stow all of our weapons. 

## Dinner with the Wakters

We arrive at the [[Wakter House]] and are greeted by [[Ernst Lanark]]. We consume some delicious [[Red Dragon Crush]] wine.  We wait in the sitting room and see 5 portraits, [[Nikoli Wakter]], [[Lady Fiona Wakter]], [[Anton Wakter]], [[Luvis Wakter]] and [[Stella Wakter]]. [[Ernst Lanark|Ernst]] brings us into the dining room with a dignified [[Lady Fiona Wakter|Fiona]], [[Luvis Wakter|Luvis]] & [[Anton Wakter|Anton]]. The room is old but quite elegant. We are served wolf meat roast rump with more wine. She openly uses [[Count Strahd von Tzarovich|Strahd's]] name openly and without fear. We offer our opinions of the [[Burgomaster "Baron" Vargas Velokovich|Burgomaster]] and say he has a very veiled mind and conscious of reputation. We bring up [[Barononette Victor Velokovich|Victor]] and she refuses to see leadership passed to him after [[Burgomaster "Baron" Vargas Velokovich|Vargas]]. She asks if we would help remove the [[Burgomaster "Baron" Vargas Velokovich|Baron]]. We trade [[Victor's Journal]] with [[Lady Fiona Wakter|Fiona]] as part of a deal to take over the [[Mansion of Burgomaster Velokovich]]. We enter into a blood pack with [[Lady Fiona Wakter]] to remove the [[Burgomaster "Baron" Vargas Velokovich]]. We are to dispose of him and remove him during the [[Valakki Weekly Festival]]. We are to kill the [[Burgomaster "Baron" Vargas Velokovich|Baron]] and [[Captain Izek]] and capture [[Barononette Victor Velokovich]]. We agreed to also try and help heal [[Stella Wakter]], but maybe [[Sumrak]] can help. We will meet back up at [[Wakter House]] and rehash the plan.

We climb upstairs to find [[Stella Wakter]] acting like a crazy cat. [[Fyndal Kayne|Fyndal]] gains her trust with a good old fashioned "pspspsps".  [[Saraphina Blackwood]] uses illusion and puts a laser on the wall. We are unable to diagnose or help [[Stella Wakter]] and maybe we can help her with the spell Greater Restoration. 

We walk back to the inn and identify [[Vayl Veliknova]]'s axe. It is a cursed berzerker axe +1. This shit is bad. [[Granny Morgan]]'s meat pies are made out of human flesh. We spend the night in the [[Velakki Inn]].

## The next day
We meet [[Irwin]] the innkeeper. [[Saraphina Blackwood]] & [[Sumrak]] speak with [[Retavio the Great]]. We recommend [[Retavio the Great]] to apply to be a distraction at the [[Valakki Weekly Festival]]. We make our way to [[Bluto]]'s house and immediately break in. We find child's clothes and her doll. Her name is [[Aribella]]. We find dishes in the sink. We decide to go to the north gate and head to [[Lake Tzarovich]]. We ask the guards about [[Bluto]]'s whereabouts and we believe he has [[Aribella]] in a bag and we fear his is going to throw her in the lake. We find only 2 rowboats on the shore and think that [[Bluto]] is going to drown this girl. We save [[Aribella]] from being drowned by [[Bluto]]. We capture [[Bluto]] and walk back to [[Town of Velakki|Velakki]] but are denied at the gate because [[Vistani]] aren't allowed in the gate.

We walk to the [[Vistani]] camp. We enter the main tent where we encounter [[Alexi]] being whipped. We meet [[Luvosh]], the leader of the [[Vistani]] and father to [[Aribella]]. [[Alexi]] was being whipped for not watching [[Aribella]]. We unknowingly complete a quest and are rewarded for rescuing [[Aribella]]. We accept an iron chest of 650 Gold pieces as a reward. We look around the lower section of the camp and look for a [[Dusk Elf]]. [[Vayl Veliknova|Vayl]] finds a [[Dusk Elf]] and meets [[Kasimir]], another [[Dusk Elf]]. [[Kasimir]] is related to [[Vayl Veliknova]].

We head back to town and look for [[Milevoj]], but he is still not conscious. We then speak with [[Leopard von Doyle]] and he wants us to deal with the leviathan in [[Lake Tzarovich]]. We purchase horses. We return to the inn and pick up [[Marcus Darkhelm]].

## Plan for Next Session
- See [[Milevoj]]
-  Deal with [[Granny Morgan]]
- See [[Vistani]] camp to talk to [[Kasimir]].
