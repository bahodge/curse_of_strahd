[[Count Strahd von Tzarovich]] tells us it isn't safe to roam the halls at night. [[Sumrak]] get some goat cheese to accompany her reading.

We make our way up to the 4th floor where we discover paintings of [[Count Strahd von Tzarovich|Strahd]] that wink back at us. We enter a small lounge that are in disrepair. We are locked in the bedroom by [[Cyrus Bellevue]]. [[Esher]] comes up to the room and we speak through the locked door. He describes how to get to the dungeons from the room. We assume that [[Count Strahd von Tzarovich|Strahd]] knows all that goes on through the castle, likely through the paintings on the walls.

[[Cyrus Bellevue]] has a hall of bones which is related to one of the prophecy.  We decide to read the books and go to sleep.

We read the [[Tome of Strahd]] and I learn that [[Vayl Veliknova]]'s mother [[Patrina Veliknova]] taught [[Count Strahd von Tzarovich]] how to become immortal.

We discover a trap door in the closet of the room that we were staying in with a ladder leading up. We notice some scuff marks on the floor. We don't follow them and walk through another door to a room covered in claw marks. We find a bunch of cats. We go into the room with scuff marks and find a room with a bunch of alchemy things.

We climb up another set of stairs and come across a giant heart suspended above a bottomless pit. We walk in and a bunch of halberds come to life and attack us, we run away. We see a single chimney that we think is a good entry point back into the castle.

We head back to the [[Town of Velakki]] and meet up with [[Muriel Vensha]] and decide to head to the [[Wizards of Wine]].

Next time:
- go to the [[Wizards of Wine]]
