### Western Velakki

We come to a lake as we approach the mage tower with [[Rudolph Van Richten]] is located. We arrive at the tower and see [[Rudolph Van Richten|Rudolph]] and another figure. They are locked outside of the mage tower as it is protected by a magical aura. [[Rudolph Van Richten]] took on a new mentee [[Esmeralda D'avenir]]. [[Rudolph Van Richten]], came to the [[Kingdom of Barovia]] to kill [[Count Strahd von Tzarovich]] and free the lands.

[[Rudolph Van Richten]] and [[Esmeralda D'avenir]] fought and almost killed [[Count Strahd von Tzarovich]] about a year ago but [[Count Strahd von Tzarovich]] came back the next week and he was fine.  

### Mage Tower

We disarm a trap door leading into the the tower by dancing. We walk into the first room where we suspect that there is a puzzle to proceed to the next room. There is a magical platform that responds to voice commands to ascend and descend. We steal a chest from the mage tower where we encounter a bunch of very scary golums.

[[Vayl Veliknova]] is knocked down and receives a wound.

Inside the chest we find a robe of useful of items, pearl (of power), journal and a ring of spell storing. We decide to head to the [[Village of Kresk]] to look for a place to heal us with greater restoration. 

### Journey to Kresk

We travel towards the [[Village of Kresk]] and pass a trail called [[Tsoylinka Pass]]. We come upon a thatch house that is semi destroyed. [[Sumrak]] approaches 2 bodies and speaks with dead. Turns out they were wereboars and a werewolf killed them and destroyed their home. 

We continue towards the city and come across another destroyed home made out of wood. We speak with more dead bodies and discover that the werewolf has taken their child.

We continue towards the city, and arrive at the city and hear a loud bell emanating from an abbey which is related to [[Madam Ava]]'s prophesy. We can't get into the city without helping them get a cart of wine. We head back to the [[Town of Velakki]]

### Town of Velakki

[[Vayl Veliknova]] equips a necklace to be delivered to [[Cyrus Bellevue]]. We go to the bathhouse and clean up in preparation for the dance at [[Dinner at Castle Ravenloft]]. We begin asking other's in the town to come with us as +1s to the dinner. [[Vayl Veliknova]] asks [[Head Matron Claudia Belasco]].

We invite [[Leopard von Doyle]], [[Head Matron Claudia Belasco]], [[Ophilia]], [[Lady Fiona Wakter]] & [[Etiene]]. We go to bed and sleep at the [[Velakki Inn]].

[[Vayl Veliknova]] is no longer wounded. We speak with [[Milevoj]] and turn in the necklaces of the lost children.

[[Vayl Veliknova]] is sneaking in the cane sword and thieves tools.
