[[Saraphina Blackwood]] enters the cave and observes all of the gore in the cave. [[Sumrak]] gains the ability to turn into a werewolf at will. [[Sumrak]] no longer needs the sickles and should return them [[Zulika Toranzku]]. We decide to head back to the [[Village of Kresk]] to see the [[Abbot of Kresk]] with [[Saraphina Blackwood]].

We speak with the [[Burgomaster Dimitri Kreskov]] and get paid 1200gp to pay for plate armor from the blacksmith. [[Vayl Veliknova]] dons the new plate armor and looks cool as fuck.

## Abby of Kresk

We head to the [[Abby of Kresk]] and speak with the [[Abbot of Kresk]]. [[Saraphina Blackwood]] doesn't like they way the [[Mongrelfolk]] look and looks disgusted. We recap that the [[Abbot of Kresk]] has been in seclusion since the [[Dinner at Castle Ravenloft]]. We are pretty sure that the [[Abbot of Kresk|Abbot]] is immortal. We mill about the courtyard and then move to the [[Abby of Kresk Graveyard]]. [[Fyndal Kayne]] examines the graves and doesn't notice anything unusual. [[Zygfrek Bellevue]] says they take a lot of pride maintaining the the Abby.
