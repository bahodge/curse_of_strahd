We go to the church of [[Saint Andarel]] looking for [[Father Lucian Petrovich]] but he isn't there. We assume that he is at the [[Festival of the Blazing Sun]]. We arrive at the festival and split up to gather more information prior the actual ceremony.

We shuffle through the crowd and speak with attendees. We notice that friends/relatives of [[Lady Fiona Wakter]] begin walking into a building.

[[Willamina Lucovich]] speaks out against the [[Burgomaster "Baron" Vargas Velokovich]]. The Baron orders [[Captain Izek]] to arrest her and [[The Grimmwood Syndicate]] begins inciting a riot. A citizen is stabbed and the guards are blamed. The citizens begin to shout and draw weapons.

We kill [[Barononette Victor Velokovich]], [[Burgomaster "Baron" Vargas Velokovich]] and [[Captain Izek]] in a massive battle in the town square.

Next Session:
- continue combat
