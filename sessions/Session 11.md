We arrive in the [[Town of Velakki]] and and meet [[Muriel Vensha]], who we believe is tied to the [[Ravens]]. We offer to help her find the shipment for [[Irwin]]. 

We head to the [[Velakki Orphanage]] and meet with [[Head Matron Claudia Belasco]]. We meet [[Milevoj]] and speak about the bones of [[Saint Andarel]]. [[Gell Wiildheart]] and [[Vayl Veliknova|Vayl]] play with the kids while [[Sumrak]], [[Saraphina Blackwood|Saraphina]] and [[Fyndal Kayne|Fyndal]] speak with [[Milevoj]]. [[Milevoj]] mentioned the bones to [[Henrik Vander Vurt]] very likely has the bones. We walk to [[Comfy Coffin Co.]] where [[Henrik Vander Vurt]] works.

[[Henrik Vander Vurt]] definitely knows where the bones are but he is unwilling to hand them over. [[Sumrak]] wants to turn into [[Milevoj]] and trick [[Henrik Vander Vurt]]. [[Sumrak]] casts remove curse on [[Vayl Veliknova]] and allows her to drop the cursed axe. Found the bones and are actively running away from the vampire spawns.
