We leave [[Castle Ravenloft]] and long rest in the [[Town of Velakki]]. We begin making our way to the [[Wizards of Wine]] winery and share the details of the books we read. [[Vayl Veliknova]] shares the details of the [[Brief History of Barovia]]. [[Fyndal Kayne]] learned that the [[Amber Temple]] is ancient. They dedicated the temple a god of secrets, but failed and were corrupted. [[Gell Wiildheart]] lets us know we should stay away from the mountains because of all the scary creatures there. [[Sumrak]] lets everyone know she is sorry for not telling everyone she's a warewolf.

We arrive at the [[Wizards of Wine]] and meet [[Adrien Vensha]], [[Muriel Vensha]]'s brother. [[Adrien Vensha]] let's us know that the [[Wildfolk]] have attacked the winery. We learn about [[Davian Vensha]], the father of [[Muriel Vensha|Muriel]] & [[Adrien Vensha|Adrien]]. We likely will not be able to reason with the [[Wildfolk]] so we may have to kill all of them.

In the vineyard, there are 3 fields. 2 of them are unused. We must protect the good field.  [[Davian Vensha]] informs us that there is ample wine. We kill the boss and take his [[Gulthias Staff]]. We kill many of his minions and druids. We learn that the [[Wildfolk]] have stolen a gem gifted to the [[Vensha Family]] which allows them to grow grapes.

Next time:
- go to [[Yester Hill]] and retrieve the gems that help the fields grow. Probably will have to kill a bunch of people.
