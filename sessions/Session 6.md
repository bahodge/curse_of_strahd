We meet [[Father Lucian Petrovich]] of the [[Saint Andarel]]'s church. The church used to be consecrated but the source of the consecration has gone missing. Underneath the church is a tomb, where the bones of [[Saint Andarel]] were kept, but they disappeared. They were last seen a week ago. [[Willamina Lucovich]] is asked to leave the church by [[Father Lucian Petrovich|father lucian]] who requests prayers for [[Udo Lucovich]] 23, her son. Her son is fool-hearted and protested against the celebrations in the [[Town of Velakki]] and was taken by [[Captain Izek]]. [[Yeska]], the alterboy is suspected in [[Milevoj]] the gravekeeper, an let is slip where the bones were kept. [[Milevoj]] lives in the [[Velakki Orphanage]]

We arrive at the orphanage and meet the [[Head Matron Claudia Belasco]]. We are informed that [[Milevoj]] is sickly, looking pallid and gross. We discover infernal markings on all the beds except for one bed [[Felix]]. We meet a girl [[Tessa]] who tells us the goings on in the [[Velakki Orphanage]].  We investigate a broken window in the [[Velakki Orphanage]] and it looks like a child was pushed out. We find a locket. We find the attic of the [[Velakki Orphanage]] and climb up and begin exploring. We find [[Felix]] in the attic where he is torturing a girl. He begins speaking infernal, and attacks us. There is a shadowy creature behind him that attacks us. We defeated the [[Shadow Demon]]. We were arrested for using magic and brought before [[Burgomaster "Baron" Vargas Velokovich]].

The [[Burgomaster "Baron" Vargas Velokovich]] listens to our arguments and grants us permission to use magic and weapons. He asks us to "remove" someone named [[Lady Fiona Wakter]], a suspected cult leader. We meet [[Captain Izek]], who is a confident asshole. We are granted lodging by the [[Burgomaster "Baron" Vargas Velokovich]] at the [[Velakki Inn]].

We are told by the innkeeper that using silver currency is frowned upon. We are not sure why. We buy lodging and dinner. [[Vayl Veliknova]] and [[Fyndal Kayne]] start a drinking contest with each other. [[Fyndal Kayne]], drunk, fucks with some frat boys and ruins an interaction [[Saraphina Blackwood]] wanted to have with them. [[Saraphina Blackwood]] speaks with [[Retavio the Great]] and learns a little more about [[Lady Fiona Wakter]].

Plan for next session
- Check in with [[Father Lucian Petrovich]]
- Look into [[Lady Fiona Wakter]] and see if she is good or bad
