We start off running away from vampire spawn while [[Vayl Veliknova]] is carrying the chest with bones. The vampire spawn scattered away from the city. We try to intervene with some vampire spawns before they killed some civilians but only managed to kill 2 after they murdered them.
We start off running away from vampire spawn while [[Vayl Veliknova]] is carrying the chest with bones. The vampire spawn scattered away from the city. We try to intervene with some vampire spawns before they killed some civilians but only managed to kill 2 after they murdered them.

We try to save the civilians in from of the [[Church of Saint Andarel]] where we are attacked by 2 more vampire spawn. We encounter [[Count Strahd von Tzarovich]] in front of the church and [[Father Lucian Petrovich]] is commanded to let the vampire spawn in. We kill all of the vampire spawn. [[Yeska]] takes the bones of [[Saint Andarel]] and replaces them in the [[Church of Saint Andarel]].  [[Count Strahd von Tzarovich|Strahd]] flies away.

[[Count Strahd von Tzarovich]] refers to [[Saraphina Blackwood]] as [[Tatiana]]. We learn that [[Saraphina Blackwood]] bears a striking resemblence to a description of a girl in the [[Village of Berez]] where she was bitten 2 times by [[Count Strahd von Tzarovich|Strahd]]. She was killed by the village people in an attempt to save her soul.

We take a short rest at the [[Church of Saint Andarel]] and discuss our plan going forward to address [[Lady Fiona Wakter]]. 

[[Lady Fiona Wakter]], got 3 prophesies from [[Madam Ava]]. 
- There will be an outsider to [[Town of Velakki]]
- They will come and cause terror
- There will be light shed on the city after the outsider is destroyed.

We confirm that [[Lady Fiona Wakter]] is against [[Count Strahd von Tzarovich]] and reaffirm our arrangement her to kill the [[Burgomaster "Baron" Vargas Velokovich]].

We speak with [[Muriel Vensha]] and [[Irwin Martikov]] and learn that there is an evil tree at [[Yester Hill]]. She speaks about a powerful healer in [[Village of Kresk]] who is being harried by a pack of warewolves. [[Castle Ravenloft]] is built upon the pillars of stone. She also says she also saw a dragon at [[Argynvostholt]].

We travel to the [[Vistani]] camp and met up with [[Kasimir]]. They have confirmed that [[Vayl Veliknova]] is indeed related to the Viliknova line. My mother wanted to become a bride of [[Count Strahd von Tzarovich]]. As a reprisal, she was stoned to death. [[Rahadeen]] came in the night and killed all of the female dusk elves. [[Count Strahd von Tzarovich]] took her remains and buried them in the catacombs of the [[Castle Ravenloft]]. We need to sneak in. [[Count Strahd von Tzarovich]] is rumored to have gained his powers from the [[Amber Temple]] with dealings with a faceless god.
