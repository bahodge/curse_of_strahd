## Werewolf Cave

[[Saraphina Blackwood]] enters the cave and observes all of the gore in the cave. [[Sumrak]] gains the ability to turn into a werewolf at will. [[Sumrak]] no longer needs the sickles and should return them [[Zulika Toranzku]]. We decide to head back to the [[Village of Kresk]] to see the [[Abbot of Kresk]] with [[Saraphina Blackwood]].

## Village of Kresk

We speak with the [[Burgomaster Dimitri Kreskov]] and get paid 1200gp to pay for plate armor from the blacksmith. [[Vayl Veliknova]] dons the new plate armor and looks cool as fuck.

## Abby of Kresk

We head to the [[Abby of Kresk]] and speak with the [[Abbot of Kresk]]. [[Saraphina Blackwood]] doesn't like they way the [[Mongrelfolk]] look and looks disgusted. We recap that the [[Abbot of Kresk]] has been in seclusion since the [[Dinner at Castle Ravenloft]]. We are pretty sure that the [[Abbot of Kresk|Abbot]] is immortal. We mill about the courtyard and then move to the [[Abby of Kresk Graveyard]]. [[Fyndal Kayne]] examines the graves and doesn't notice anything unusual. [[Zygfrek Bellevue]] says they take a lot of pride maintaining the the Abby. 

[[Saraphina Blackwood]] is introduced to the [[Abbot of Kresk]]. He says he may have a solution to her predicament. We give them a bunch of dire wolf carcasses for eating. We learn that [[Count Strahd von Tzarovich|Strahd]] has been killed many times, but because the land is cursed, he always comes back. [[Saraphina Blackwood]] is told that she can soften [[Count Strahd von Tzarovich]]'s heart and make him vulnerable. If we can make [[Count Strahd von Tzarovich|Strahd]] happy, we may be able to lift the curse on the land. The last time he tried to present the version of [[Tatiana]], [[Count Strahd von Tzarovich|Strahd]] ripped it apart. [[Saraphina Blackwood|Saraphina]] agrees to try and teach a new [[flesh golem]] incarnation how to be more like [[Tatiana]]. We need to collect body parts of previous incarnations of [[Tatiana]] to construct a new [[flesh golem]].

We think that this [[flesh golem]] will is part of the [[Session 5 - Reading]] done by [[Madam Ava]]. We also learn that the [[Bellevue Family]] asked for help from the [[Abbot of Kresk]] who healed them and improved them by giving them new body parts. We think that [[Saraphina Blackwood]] might have been smuggled out of the missed long ago and lost her memory.

On the way out, [[Fyndal Kayne]] looks again and sees that there is a grave with a 3 inch diameter [[sun shaped indentation]] on the gravestone. We are unaware of who's crest would fit in the indentation. The grave belongs to [[Tasha Petrovna]].

## Werewolves

We inform [[Zulika Toranzku]] that we did not find [[Emil Toranzku]] and tell her that we killed [[Kiril Tsoylonovich]]. [[Sumrak]] gives her back the sickles because she deepened her pact. [[Zulika Toranzku]] is angry about [[Emil Toranzku]]. She tells us that we can count on the werewolves that 

## Town of Vellakki

We arrive at the town and the general feeling is very happy. [[The Triumvirate]] is going really well. [[Gell Wiildheart|Gell]] and [[Vayl Veliknova|Vayl]] go to the bar and ask [[Irwin Martikov]] about the missing gem. He didn't see anything on the night the gem was taken. We ask and we think that the [[wereraven]]s would not take the gem. Based off of [[Irwin Martikov]]'s description, we think that a flying creature stole the gem.

[[Fyndal Kayne]] and [[Vayl Veliknova]] didn't benefit anything throughout the long rest because the treasure was cursed. We go to the tailor and see a dwarf named [[Brogan Ironforge]]. We order the dress but it will take 2 weeks.

[[Vayl Veliknova]] and [[Fyndal Kayne]] go to see [[Father Lucian Petrovich]] and try and get them decursed. We pay him and now are uncursed. We also ask if he knows anything about the [[sun shaped indentation]]. He tells us that he saw a painting of [[Tasha Petrovna]] in [[Castle Ravenloft]].

[[Gell Wiildheart]] goes to the [[Comfy Coffin Co.]] and speaks with the owner. [[Gell Wiildheart]] tells him that the [[Abbot of Kresk]] can fix his ugly daughter. 

The party goes to the [[Wakter House]] to see [[Lady Fiona Wakter]]. [[Ernst Lanark]] lets them in and fetches [[Lady Fiona Wakter]]. We ask for a wedding dress and she agrees. We tell [[Lady Fiona Wakter]] that we helped her daughter and restored the [[Wizards of Wine]]. We think we can get the dress cleaned and altered at the tailor.

At that point [[Granny Morgan]] speaks with [[Fyndal Kayne]] through the sending stone (rocky talky). She says that [[Count Strahd von Tzarovich|Strahd]] is angry and leaving [[Castle Ravenloft]]. We tell [[wereraven]]s to warn everyone. [[Sumrak]] awoos and warns the other [[werewolf|werewolves]]. 

[[Fyndal Kayne]] asks a god for help and unintentionally tells [[Count Strahd von Tzarovich]] where all of his enemies are. We decide that we are going go to the [[Western Mage Tower]] to try and intervene between [[Count Strahd von Tzarovich]] and everyone.

## Western Mage Tower

We go to the [[Western Mage Tower]] and warn everyone to scatter. We run away to [[Village of Berez]] and as we are leaving we see [[Count Strahd von Tzarovich]] blow up the the tower.

## Village of Berez

The mud is thick and the mud makes every step off.
