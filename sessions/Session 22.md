## Werewolf Cave

[[Saraphina Blackwood]] enters the cave and observes all of the gore in the cave. [[Sumrak]] gains the ability to turn into a werewolf at will. [[Sumrak]] no longer needs the sickles and should return them [[Zulika Toranzku]]. We decide to head back to the [[Village of Kresk]] to see the [[Abbot of Kresk]] with [[Saraphina Blackwood]].

## Village of Kresk

We speak with the [[Burgomaster Dimitri Kreskov]] and get paid 1200gp to pay for plate armor from the blacksmith. [[Vayl Veliknova]] dons the new plate armor and looks cool as fuck.

## Abby of Kresk

We head to the [[Abby of Kresk]] and speak with the [[Abbot of Kresk]]. [[Saraphina Blackwood]] doesn't like they way the [[Mongrelfolk]] look and looks disgusted. We recap that the [[Abbot of Kresk]] has been in seclusion since the [[Dinner at Castle Ravenloft]]. We are pretty sure that the [[Abbot of Kresk|Abbot]] is immortal.

[[Saraphina Blackwood]] is told that she can soften [[Count Strahd von Tzarovich]]'s heart and make him vulnerable. If we can make [[Count Strahd von Tzarovich|Strahd]] happy, we may be able to lift the curse on the land. The last time he tried to present the version of [[Tatiana]], [[Count Strahd von Tzarovich|Strahd]] ripped it apart. [[Saraphina Blackwood|Saraphina]] agrees to try and teach a new [[flesh golem]] incarnation how to be more like [[Tatiana]]. We need to collect body parts of previous incarnations of [[Tatiana]] to construct a new [[flesh golem]].

We think that this [[flesh golem]] will is part of the [[Session 5 - Reading]] done by [[Madam Ava]].

We also learn that the [[Bellevue Family]] asked for help from the [[Abbot of Kresk]] who healed them and improved them by giving them new body parts. 

We think that [[Saraphina Blackwood]] might have
