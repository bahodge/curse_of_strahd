### Town square

[[Fyndal Kayne]] spoke with [[Leopard von Doyle]] and we are surprised that he put his name in the running for burgomaster. He says that he is going grow the [[Town of Velakki]]'s prosperity. [[Fyndal Kayne]] also speaks with [[Willamina Lucovich]] and we we assure her that we are still actively looking for the prison where [[Udo Lucovich]] is kept.

[[Gell Wiildheart]] speaks with the burgomaster's wife and apologizes for the death of her family and she runs off to the [[Mansion of Burgomaster Velokovich]]. 

[[Saraphina Blackwood]], speaks with [[Muriel Vensha]] and she said that she hopes that the festivals do continue. She also speaks with [[Retavio the Great]] and thanks him for saving him. She asks why he saved her and he says that she bears a striking resemble. [[Vayl Veliknova]] notices a familiar sword held by [[Retavio the Great]] and he actually is [[Rudolph Van Richten]] in shapeshift form. He tells us to meet him at the mage tower.

[[Sumrak]] slinks away to the shadows, changes into a commoners and casts speak with dead on [[Barononette Victor Velokovich]].

	- they aren't there anymore, they went through the teleporter

[[Vayl Veliknova]] speaks with [[Head Matron Claudia Belasco]] and her plans are to spread wealth between the poor and rich to create a middle class.

Looting [[Burgomaster "Baron" Vargas Velokovich]], we find has ornate breastplate armor that needs to repaired for half cost (200gp).

### Mansion of the Burgomaster

We head to the [[Mansion of Burgomaster Velokovich]] to investigate the house and hear a lot of commotion. We search [[Captain Izek]]'s room and look for the dungeon. We go into the dungeon and find manacles and [[Udo Lucovich]]. We strap his body to the horse. We all move upstairs into the master bedroom. We see [[Lydia]] packing frantically and about light her wedding dress. She lights the dress on fire and dashes out of the room. We go to [[Barononette Victor Velokovich]]'s workshop. We see inanimate skeletal cats. We find a working teleporter but don't know where the teleporter goes. Those kids are likely dead as fuck.

We take [[Udo Lucovich]]'s body to [[Willamina Lucovich]]. She is angry and hates us but she blames [[Captain Izek]].

### Travel to vistani camp

As we are riding to the [[Vistani]] camp, and are intercepted by [[Rahadeen]] who hands us a letter from [[Count Strahd von Tzarovich|Strahd]].

### Eastern Vistani Camp

We arrive at the [[Vistani]] camp and speak with [[Madam Ava]]. We learn that we could take power from [[Count Strahd von Tzarovich]] if we transfer his powers to the old gods (raven, bear & wolf). We engage [[Loremaster Stanmere]] to learn how to dance like a [[Vistani]] in preparation for the dinner at [[Count Strahd von Tzarovich]].

We learn the dances of the [[Vistani]] from [[Loremaster Stanmere]] at the [[Eastern Vistani Camp]]. We also recall that there was a shop in the [[Town of Velakki]] where we can learn more traditional dances of the [[Kingdom of Barovia]]. We spend the night.
